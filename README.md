# CS-4910 (Computer Graphics)
This is the final project for CS-4910 (Computer Graphics). This is an efficient ray tracer made using KD-Trees and multihtreading.  

This project includes a makefile which writes the rendered image to a file called image.ppm and displays it after compiling the project.  

In order to change the scene, use main.cpp to add any objects or parse any obj files.  

In order to toggle between multithreading and regular raytracing, go to camera.h and change #define MT to switch between options.  

In order to change camera position, go to camera.h and change the center in the initialize function.
